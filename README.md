# Instant Messenger


## Getting Started

A few packages were used in the process of creating this project. I have listed the ones which are necessary to host the website.

## To Do List
- [ ] Functioning basic server & client.
- [ ] When a client connects, display a message.
- [ ] **More than 1 client** can connect.
- [ ] Use a dictionary to store all the current connections.
- [ ] Client can send **custom messages**.
- [ ] Clients can send **multiple messages**.
- [ ] Clients can enter a username.
- [ ] Usernames displayed in front of each message.
- [ ] When a client disconnects, display a message.
- [ ] Make sure the server does not crash (when someone leaves).

- [ ] `server.log` is produced when the server is run.
The log should contain information about:
- [ ] all clients connecting/disconnecting
- [ ] any sent messages
